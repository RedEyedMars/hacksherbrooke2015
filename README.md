# HackSherbrooke 2015 - Visual Data Portal

## Visualizations Of Open City Data

We've scraped a number of open resources (CSVs, JSON and even 
PDF's) from the city of Sherbrooke, produced visualizations of the data and assembled them into an easy-to-use web interface.

Most of these proesses are fully automated by python scripts in ./py/, and could be scheduled or event driven through an API.

The application itself is static, written in javascript with the knockout framework.

To get started simply navigate to the index.html document in your browser!
